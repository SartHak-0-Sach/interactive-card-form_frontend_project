## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to create the Interactive Card Details Form, a beautifully designed form component of a banking website's landing page. Users should be able to-
- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time.
- Error messages are displayed if any input field is empty or if the card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format.
- Users should also be able to view the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size and see hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SartHak-0-Sach/interactive-card-form_frontend_project.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

You will find all the required assets in the `/design` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.

### What I learned

This project can be a great teacher to anyone trying to implement all elements as according to design files and validation using javaScript as shown below-

```js
cardForm.addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (nameValidation()) {
        holderNameText.innerText = holderNameInput.value;
        expirationDate.innerText = `${monthInput.value}/${yearInput.value}`;
        cvcText.innerText = cvcInput.value;
        const holderCardNumber = holderCardNumberInput.value.replace(" ", "").match(/.{1,4}/g).join(" ");
        cardNumberText.innerText = holderCardNumber;
        cardForm.classList.add("hidden");
        successDialog.classList.remove("hidden");
    } else {
        alert("Please fill the form properly.");
        return;
    }
})
```

### Continued development

The continuously learning journey of a programmer never ends. This project made me realize that there are many concepts that I need to work upon including fundamentals like flex-box and its properties, to more complex concepts like working with fetch and async await in javascript. These areas are some that I think I need to work more upon in the upcoming future as they highlight some of the most significant regions of web development that are important for every developer to know of. 

These key points mentioned here will help me grow accountable and consistent towards improving at writing good quality code and be a successful full stack developer one day.
